Each time a new attendee signs up for your event on Eventbrite, send an email from your gmail address stating that someone has just signed up including their name & city in the body of the email. The flow then sends a message on Slack alerting the channel of a new sign up with the same information.

Before you use this flow, you should have an Eventbrite account with an event people are signing up to, a Gmail account to send the emails from, a Slack account to connect and a Slack channel that you want the messages to be sent to.
