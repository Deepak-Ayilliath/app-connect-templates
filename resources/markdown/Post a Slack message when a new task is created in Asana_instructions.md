To refer to these instructions while editing the flow, open [the github page](https://github.com/ot4i/app-connect-templates/blob/master/resources/markdown/Post%20a%20Slack%20message%20when%20a%20new%20task%20is%20created%20in%20Asana_instructions.md) (opens in a new window).

This flow will monitor your Asana account for any new added tasks. When a new task is added to your Asana workspace, this will trigger the flow to post a message to your Slack channel that a new Asana task has been added, notifying you of the task name and due date. 

Before you use this flow, you must ensure the following:
- You have a Slack account with a workspace and channel
- You have a Asana account with a workspace/organization, and at least one project set up in Asana. App Connect will monitor the workspace/organization (or optional team) for any new tasks created in the project.
